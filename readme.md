# worms.js
This is a simple worms engine implementation, originally based off of onelonecoder's worms for C++ series. However, I intend on making mine a lot more polished and feature-full, for use in later projects.

## Contribution
Since this project uses ESModules, you have to spin up a local server, and serve the files that way (in order to avoid CORS issues).
I'm a github & git noob, so teach me how to merge your request if you have one.
